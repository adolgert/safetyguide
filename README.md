# Safety Guide

This repository is a set of suggestions for how to write research code in an R package. I'm thinking of someone who wants to run scripts that do statistical modeling on their laptop or on the cluster. It includes vignettes on the topics of:

- Package use
- Logging
- Organization of code
- Formatting code
- Configuration files and command-line arguments
- Testing
- Documentation
- Provenance

Look at the Articles tab, above.
